# Sensitivity Analysis of Stroke Predictors Using Structural Equation Modeling and Bayesian Networks

This repository contains the code used on the paper of same name published on the **IEEE CIBCB'22** conference:

> H. C. R. Oliveira, S. Yanushkevich and M. Almekhlafi, "Sensitivity Analysis of Stroke Predictors Using Structural Equation Modeling and Bayesian Networks," **2022 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)**, 2022, pp. 1-8, doi: [10.1109/CIBCB55180.2022.9863028](http://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB55180.2022.9863028).

## Reproducibility

To make the experiments presented here reproducible, many seed parameters were fixed into the code.
More over, the BNs created in this paper were exported using the [PyAgrum](https://agrum.gitlab.io/pages/pyagrum.html) library and can be found in this repository in files with `.bif` extension.

## Data

The data used for this study is freely available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
